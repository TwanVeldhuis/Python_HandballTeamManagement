# Handball Team Management
This object-oriented program is built to register and administrate handball teams for a handball event. The program itself is controllable using a console menu and is only made to manage the teams within the event. The program will not keep track of any games or results that take place in during the event. The program can apply all the CRUD operations on these teams and these are specifically:
 - Create
    - Create a Team
 - Read
    - List the teams on individual/filtered level
    - List all the teams
 - Update
    - Update a team property
 - Delete
    - Delete a Team  

Furthermore, the program can do some other things that are not part of the CRUD operations: it can cancel a team for participating in the event (without deleting the team), it can count the number of current teams participating at the event, the percentage of teams that paid the fee of all the teams that are participating at the event and all this information can be saved and retrieved again from a text file that is also still readable as a person.
